# Objects

## Experimentation

I think I want to reorganize the encapsulation a bit.

Currently we have two main objects: The LSystem and the Turtle. Plus
unintelligent data objects for the different parts of the plant (meristem, stem,
leaves).

I want to try reorganizing things so that the replacing and drawing rules are
encapsulated within the different parts of the plant.

I think this will make it easier to iterate and create different plants.

## Genetic mutation

Eventually I want to add some genetic algorithm-y stuff to this project, so I
want to do some research to figure out what object structure works best in that
case.

But I think the "Experimentation" structure will work well for this playing
around.
