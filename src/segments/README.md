# Segment

A segment is a piece of an L-System that has information necessary for the
segment to be turtle-interpretted and visualized to the user. E.g. length, width, color, etc, info.

A segment is also serializable and deserializable so that it can be saved
and loaded.

Segments can be assembled into a recursive tree data structure of segments.
